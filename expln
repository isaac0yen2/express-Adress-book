1 create the log in page that accepts users data and stors it into a database
2 every registered user is a table
3 There yould be a separate table for username and password authentication and there would be tables for  every user in the same database.
4 what the user enters the app...they see as homepage consisting of a log in form containing the input for username and password
there would be a link as well that would direct them to a page where they will register their username and password.
when they register, the function handler will take in their information and run an sql code to create a table for them this the username as the name and include the user as part of the aunthetication table. they will eb redirected to the home page afterwards
when they login, the action would be to an auntheitcation handler which would retrieve all the information from the aunthetication table and verify if the username matches the password.(SELECT * FORM aunthetication WHERE name=`'${req.body.username}'`) once this is true they will be redirected to the user router with a prarmeter that the user function handler would use to retrieve all the informatiom from the table and render it.



now youve been able to do all that...you have a problem getting the table name so that ypou can specify the record exactly the info should be deleted.
